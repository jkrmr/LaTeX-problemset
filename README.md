problemset
==========

A LaTeX document class for problem sets.

For samples see [here](sample-brief/Problem Set 1.pdf) (a toy example) and [here](sample/MTH 427 Problem Set 6.pdf) (a real one).

###Description

The `problemset` class uses space on the page in a way that more closely resembles what one would expect from a problem set, eschewing the ample margins more appropriate to articles and manuscripts than to the typical weekly pset.

The result is a document that combines the elegance of LaTeX with the compactness and informality of a hand-written document.
